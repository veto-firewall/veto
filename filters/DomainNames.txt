# Domain Filter Examples
#
# Format:
# - Each line should contain one domain name
# - Valid domain names only (no URLs, no protocols like http://)
# - Including a domain will block/allow all its subdomains
#
# How Domain Filtering Works:
# - Adding 'example.com' will match example.com and all its subdomains
# - Adding 'sub.example.com' will only match that specific subdomain
# - Domain matching is case-insensitive (Example.com = example.com)

# Examples of blocking entire domains and their subdomains
# example.com           # Blocks example.com and all subdomains like sub.example.com
# facebook.com          # Blocks facebook.com and all subdomains
# twitter.com           # Blocks twitter.com and all subdomains

# Examples of specific subdomains
# ads.example.com       # Blocks only this specific subdomain
# tracker.website.com   # Blocks only this specific subdomain
# api.service.net       # Blocks only this specific subdomain

# Examples of common advertising/tracking domains
# doubleclick.net       # Google's ad serving platform
# googleadservices.com  # Google advertising services
# analytics.google.com  # Google Analytics

# Examples of social media domains
# facebook.com          # Facebook main domain
# instagram.com         # Instagram
# linkedin.com          # LinkedIn
# tiktok.com            # TikTok

# Uncomment domains above to block/allow them
